#Project 7 - jQuery Battle

##Scope
You've just been hired as a game developer for Games Forever to create a web game using JavaScript. You've been given total creative control with a few tiny constraints. The game needs to be controlled using the left, up, down, and right keys (or if you prefer the WASD keys)

##Project Criteria
The Manager has laid out the following requirements for the project.

* This game must use jQuery key bindings to move the character
* The user must be able to play the game using the WASD keys and the Up, Left, Down, Right keys
* It must have at least one player
* The character must have the ability to respond to other elements in the game (like an enemy or another player)
* There must be a win condition for players


##Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, the employee will be able to create interactive pages and games using key binding events with jQuery and object-oriented JavaScript to manipulate a web page or create a game.
